Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the
                die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk
                rolling a 1) or end his turn. If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated
                that turn, and he passes the die to the next player. Play passes from player to player until a winner is
                determined.
