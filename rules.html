            <li>Choose a player to go first.</li>
            <li>That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1.</li>
            <li>The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.</li>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.</li>
            <li> Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.</li>
            <li> The player who scores 100 and above before the other player emerges the winner</li>
